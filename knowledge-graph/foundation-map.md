# Luminis Foundation — Institutional Map

> Last updated: 2026-06-23
> Maintained by: Carlos Garcia (President) / Board of Directors
> Status legend: ✅ Complete | 🔄 In progress | 📋 Planned | ⬜ Future | ❓ Unknown | ⚠️ Gap
>
> Evidence confidence key: ✅ Pub = Confirmed from public repo | 📋 Legal = Confirmed from legal/state records (private) | 🗣️ Founder = Founder-confirmed | ⚠️ Conflict = Conflicted / contradicted by another source | ❓ = Missing or unknown
>
> **Important:** "Not publicly present in this repo" does not mean "does not exist." Signed bylaws, COI policies, IRS correspondence, and board minutes are expected to exist as private records held by officers. This map documents only what is knowable from public sources or confirmed by the founder.

| Board meeting minutes | Governance continuity | Store privately; keep a log |
| Organizational meeting minutes | Confirms bylaws adoption, officer elections | Store privately |
| Financial controls policy (formal adoption) | Required for grant accountability | Review draft at `governance/financial-controls-policy.md`; adopt by Board resolution |
| Field protocol documents | Research credibility; needed before deployment | Draft in `research/protocols/` |
| Calibration protocol | Data quality for any future dataset | Framework exists; final protocol pending funding |
| Data management plan | Required by many funders | Brainstorm exists; final plan pending Carlos decisions |
| Site agreements/permits | Required before field deployment | Confirm land access |
| Research ethics review | May be required for ecological sensing | Determine if IRB/IEC needed |

| Vercel hosting (MycoSense) | Infrastructure | Demo goes offline | Free tier; switch to GitHub Pages if needed |
| Zenodo (publication host) | Research infrastructure | Preprint inaccessible | DOI persists; Zenodo has high uptime |
| GitHub (repositories) | Infrastructure | Codebase inaccessible | Mirror/backup not documented |
| ESP32 supply chain | Hardware | Prototype can't be scaled | Common chip; multiple suppliers |
| Rowe, NM site access | Physical | Step 3 deployment blocked | Site ownership/access unclear |
| IRS 501(c)(3) determination | Legal/financial | Grant eligibility restricted | Form 1023-EZ filed; no controls on IRS timing |

| ✅ Revise luminis-foundation-open README: field deployment and 501(c)(3) language | Resolved | Carlos Garcia | Corrected via luminis-foundation/luminis-foundation-open#6 |
| Set Step 3 deployment date | P1 | Carlos Garcia | Unlocks research program, grant eligibility |
| Review calibration protocol framework; confirm equipment list | P1 | Carlos Garcia | Framework at `research/protocols/calibration-protocol-framework.md`; final protocol deferred to post-funding |
