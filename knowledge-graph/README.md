# Luminis Foundation — Knowledge Graph

A structured, human-readable map of everything Luminis Foundation is, has built, owns, operates, and intends to build.

## Purpose

The knowledge graph answers:

- **What are we?** Legal entity, mission, board, and legal standing
- **What have we already built?** Repositories, software, hardware, publications
- **What assets exist?** Repos, websites, hardware, data, legal records, grants
- **What is missing?** Gaps in governance, data, protocols, funding, records
- **What can fail?** See `risk/attack-surface-analysis.md`
- **What should we do next?** See `operations/next-actions.md`
- **What research pathway gets us to the first validated dataset?** See `research/research-roadmap-audit.md`
- **What should Claude, Viktor, and ChatGPT each be used for?** See `operations/agent-operating-model.md`

This is not a live database. It is a deliberately maintained institutional map updated after confirmed events only, so that any team member, funder, or AI agent has enough context to act responsibly on behalf of the Foundation.
